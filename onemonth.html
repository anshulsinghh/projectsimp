        hi emily,
        <br><br>
        as you know, i rewrote this letter 4 times bb. i know u love going to the zoo
        and looking at all the cute animals. for our one month anniversary, i made
        you an online interactive zoo on this web page ðŸ˜Ž. this letter is best viewed on 
        your mac btw so the animals are animated and everything.
        <br><br>
        sowwy i'm five days late on giving u a gift, i've been getting rly busy with work
        lately but at least i got paid today hehe. dating u has been so fun, i've loved
        every step of the way and u know that. i wanna come cuddle u rn as i'm typing this
        and i've loved all the dates, the drinking at ikea, the time we were at aesop, the
        original makeouts at mt soleded, even sunday at the club with malvika ðŸ˜‰. i've loved every second.
        <br><br>
        i can't believe it's october already, i know you have to move by the end of this
        month if u don't find something else (fingers crossed every 11:11 bb). i've done a lot
        of thinking about atlanta, and no matter what we decide, i'm still rly fixated on the
        idea that <b>you told me haha</b>: everything happens for a reason. whether u go to atlanta,
        u stay in santa clara, or whatever happens, i wanna be there for you to support u. i'm rly
        holding onto that santa clara dream baby. please let me pick u up from work, pamper u,
        take u to dinner, hold ur hand, fuck we'll even go to santana row, i'm daydreaming just
        thinking about it. i'm MANIFESTING BABEEE. it'll just be business as usual, i pick u up in
        a new car, we're both making money, fuckkkkk it'd be so fun. i'd still love being ur sugar d-
        tho.
        <br><br>
        ur the sweetest, i still think about when u took care of me when i had covid, and then
        proceeded to give it to u and your mom :(. it's rly the small things with u emily. it's
        the kisses as soon as u see me, the bouquet u made out of the ferrero rochers, all the
        trinkets i've been given, the daily support u give me, like damn. i want u to know i appreciate
        it all.
        <br><br>
        enjoy the online zoo i made u, u can feed the animals by clicking on them. make sure to enable
        javascript if they're not loading HAHA. u know i miss the fuck out of u even tho i just saw u
        on wednesday (yeah i count the days). enjoy the fishiess i think you'll like them most.
        <br><br>
        your boyfriend,
        <br>

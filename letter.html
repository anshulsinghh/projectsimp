        hi emily,
        <br><br>
        i haven't written u a love letter yet, since this is the first i
        put my <i>anshussy</i> into this. i rewrote it like 4 times so i hope u
        like it. i'm also writing this in all lowercase bc i know u love that shit.
        <br><br>
        these past 3, almost 4 months, with u have been surreal, ethereal, magical. u
        got me pulling out the big words LOL. i've loved each and every moment with u, and
        darren's right: u make me a better person. every date has been so fun, from our sunset
        date at gliderport to being annoyed at dnb with jon and ashley (RIP jashley), to having
        the most ratchet ass convos in the most boujee places. making
        u happy is one of my favorite hobbies. i always look for mexican strawberries, the right
        flowers to give u, another thrifted flannel, or just watching origami videos so i can
        make u something pretty. i've said it from the beginning, i'm just trying to make
        u as happy as possible ðŸ˜˜.
        <br><br>
        i know long distance has been hard, and i've had my moments of being unattentive, playing
        video games while texting, and just being a dumbass in general. thank u for putting up with it all. 
        we're still here 3 months later. i know atlanta may seem like it's coming soon,
        but i want to say thank u for being with me so far, i'm still manifesting the fuck out
        of santa clara. literally every 11:11 goes towards that. i want to pick u up from work,
        take you out somewhere nice, bring u flowers, watch the sunset, cuddle and watch movies,
        I WANT IT ALL. i also need my passenger princess around when i get that new bmw.
        <br><br>
        i love all the small moments with u, the little laughs, the small trinkets u give me,
        when u hug me from the back, when u cook, like shit i'm a simp for it all. thank u for being 
        here with me in this moment. although the future may seem uncertain, i think we should try
        to end things on a high note. it couldn't hurt to ask:
        <br><br>
        <i>will you be my girlfriend?</i>
        <button id="yesbtn">Yes! ðŸ’–</button>
        <br><br>
        i didn't even code a no button bc that would be negative manifestation. i rly like u.
        thank u for being with me for the ride so far.
        <br><br>
        kithes from the guy you're seeing,
